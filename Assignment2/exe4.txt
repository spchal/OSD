Real-time Scheduling
Given the processes A to C with the periods and service times in Table 1, is it possible to create a
schedule with EDF and/or RMS for a hard real-time system, i. e., without violating any
periods/deadlines? Can you make this decision without actually creating a schedule?
If it is possible, give concrete schedules for EDF and RMS! It should be clearly visible at which point
in time which process is executed. If it is not possible, show why!
Process Period Service time
A 10 2
B 12 3
C 15 6

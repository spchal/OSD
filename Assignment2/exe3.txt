Processor Utilization
Let processor utilization U be defined as the quotient of the minimally necessary time and the actual
time used for process execution. Further, let T denote the number of time units until a process is
blocked because of an I/O operation, and S the number of time units needed for a context switch.
Devise a formula for the processor utilization U in case of round robin scheduling with a time-slice of
t time units!
Interpret your formula for the following values of t:
- t->infinity ,
- S<t<T ,
- t=S , and
- t->0 !
What would be your recommendation for the length of the time-slice? Why?
Hint: The “minimally necessary time” is equal to the service time, i. e., it does not include time used
for context switches. Furthermore, assume that there are always processes ready to run.

Scheduling Strategies
Answer the following questions briefly:
- Given that the task's service time is not known in advance. How to approximate the shortest
job next strategy as close as possible?
- In proportional share scheduling, a weight is assigned to each task. What is the goal of this
weighting?
- How many processes are at least necessary to suffer from the problem of priority inversion?
How to solve this problem?
- Why should younger values of thread's execution time obtain more weight for the estimation
of CPU burst? Why are outliers better filtered by a small weight alpha?
- Why are I/O-intensive tasks more preferred to execute first?
